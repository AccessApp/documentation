## What is AccessApp?

AccessApp is a technology backed social project providing Places (museums, art galleries, universities and schools, swimming pools, beaches, everywhere, where people gather together) w/ a free and open source way to manage visitors without spending their fragile budgets on that or getting into a vendor lock.

AccessApp was designed as a forward looking solution in times of Covid, but also goes beyond that.

AccessApp consists of AccessApp Places, where the Managers of the Places can add Places and Slots, which Slots the vistors can book using AccessApp Visitors.

AccessApp comes w/ a full implementation model, described in this document.

### Where do we come from?

The AccessApp idea was born from an [article](https://voxeu.org/article/easing-lockdown-digital-applications-can-help) published on 1 May 2020 and written by Alice Mesnard and Paul Seabright. The idea was recognised by T.E. Shaw from the Linux Foundation Publish Health and a pilot implementation done w/ the help of Charlie Cox (Digytle) and a crew from Aux Nederland B.V.

### Wikipedia Operational Model (Open Source and Free For ALl)

AccessApp differs from the commercial booking apps in three ways.

* It is open source.
* It is free for all (funded through crowd donations and public funding)
* It focuses on the needs of Places and Visitors, even on the needs of marginal groups, focusing on the value creation, regardless of the commercial value.

### Benefits for Places

Places can manage the flow of visitors w/ a program, which vocuses on the needs of the Places and on the needs of the Visitors, even and especially on the needs of marginal groups of visitors such as of advanced age, fragile health or shielding due to their contact w/ vulnerable family or friends.

Places are unburdened to a maximum extent by the open source and free for all operational model and by the pool of volunteers who help w/ the implementation of AccessApp.

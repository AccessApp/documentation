## What is AccessApp?

AccessApp is a research-informed, not-for-profit booking and discovery platform to allow venues, businesses, attractions and spaces to safely provide uncrowded access to indoor and outdoor spaces thereby protecting the public's health whilst promoting public health information and encouraging the sharing of public health best practice.

Designed as a forward looking, preventative solution in response to the COVID-19 pandemic our project will be led by public health needs and the needs of the wider economy and its functionality and health information will be updated continuously in alignment with the latest government health policy and best practice from industry bodies.

AccessApp is paired with AccessApp Places app which is used by the venues managers to add their 'Place' to the platform and specify their opening and visiting information, their COVID policies and additional saftey precautions in place. The AccessApp Places app also allows create and edit specific timeslots for thier visitors and allows the creation of slots with reduced and managed capacity specifically for those that are vulnerable and shielding as well as managed slots for previously crowded and unmanaged venues, places and spaces to help protect the wider public from COVID exposure.

AccessApp is designed so that venues and venues can add themselves to the platform easily and adopt the system easily within their organisation. Together with this Installation document and accompaniying video there is also a guided walk-thru when you first install the AccessApp Places app which helps you through the process.   

### Where do we come from?

The AccessApp idea was born from an [article](https://voxeu.org/article/easing-lockdown-digital-applications-can-help) published on 1 May 2020 and written by Alice Mesnard and Paul Seabright. The idea was recognised by T.E. Shaw from the Linux Foundation Publish Health and a pilot implementation done w/ the help of Charlie Cox (Digytle) and a crew from Aux Nederland B.V.

### Wikipedia Operational Model (Open Source and Free For ALl)

AccessApp differs from the commercial booking apps in three ways.

* It is open source.
* It is free for all (funded through crowd donations and public funding)
* It focuses on the needs of Places and Visitors, even on the needs of marginal groups, focusing on the value creation, regardless of the commercial value.

### Benefits for Places

**Manage the flow of visitors.** Places can manage the flow of visitors w/ a program, which vocuses on the needs of the Places and on the needs of the Visitors, even and especially on the needs of marginal groups of visitors such as of advanced age, fragile health or shielding due to their contact w/ vulnerable family or friends.

**No financial burden or vendor lock, but material and voluntary support.** Places are unburdened to a maximum extent by the open source and free for all operational model and by the pool of volunteers who help w/ the implementation of AccessApp.

**Marketing** AccessApp helps visitors to search for and discover places, where the measures and the visitor count reverberates w/ their perception of safety.

### Benefits for Visitors

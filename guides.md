> put him on the website w/ eli

#### Ideas

Linked places where you cannot book overlapping slots and there is "travel time" => works for the Caricature Museum. Same for National History Museum and Science Museum in London.

> This can be solved in the Places app, where under each place (if you have more than one) you can mark w/ which other place there can't be overlaping bookings.

spontatneous tours. He ends a tour somewhere and gets booked "from the street".

expatcommunity

facebook events sends to booking places, but you have no idea of # of people, size of place, restaurants book table, guenther knows institutions, jewish museum in prague could be interested ! museum, cemitery and three sinagogues => perfect use case for spontaneous booking, logic for linked places that you cannot book two at the same time (justice) => tell Rosa for the ; can help w/ institutions too!; the national museum has 5 different buildins in prague, the national gallery has 5 different buildings also; 

use facebook to identify places?

Deutch Tschechichesr Zukunftsfonds http://www.fondbudoucnosti.cz/de/ we need a person who does the writing, guenther can revive his IT connections, Expat Centr in Brno, IT faculty in Masaric univserity in Brno

facebook can connect to organiser=> to explore the API

like the facebook "check in at place" => we can link to that too :) 

we can incorporate a paying function

mapy.cz => they have an app where you can participate in recognising covid problematic places, much better than google maps in prague, better than google street view

goout.cz

ticketpro

completely anonymous, no statistics gathered (no need), no data capitalism

> see how to make it work for the research parties and venues (may be we do exports or something prior to deleting...). visitor numbers are ok as they are anonymous. see how to integrate w/ the "notify visitors" requirement (collect name, address, phone).

think of the trafic light system

Next steps

- think of customer journey
-- think of target group: Use Case. Somebody together w/ people, moving around.  Teacher w/ their class going somewhere. University excursions. The unknown prague organisation, hospitals, seniors residences.
- see what adaptations will be needed in the app

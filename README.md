# AccessApp

## What is AccessApp?

AccessApp is a research-informed, not-for-profit booking and discovery platform to allow venues, businesses, attractions and spaces to safely provide uncrowded access to indoor and outdoor spaces thereby protecting the public's health whilst promoting public health information and encouraging the sharing of public health best practice.

Designed as a forward looking, preventative solution in response to the COVID-19 pandemic our project will be led by public health needs and the needs of the wider economy and its functionality and health information will be updated continuously in alignment with the latest government health policy and best practice from industry bodies.

AccessApp is paired with AccessApp Places app which is used by the venues managers to add their 'Place' to the platform and specify their opening and visiting information, their COVID policies and additional saftey precautions in place. The AccessApp Places app also allows create and edit specific timeslots for thier visitors and allows the creation of slots with reduced and managed capacity specifically for those that are vulnerable and shielding as well as managed slots for previously crowded and unmanaged venues, places and spaces to help protect the wider public from COVID exposure.

AccessApp is designed so that venues and venues can add themselves to the platform easily and adopt the system easily within their organisation. Together with this Installation document and accompaniying video there is also a guided walk-thru when you first install the AccessApp Places app which helps you through the process.

### Where do we come from?

The AccessApp idea was born from an [article](https://voxeu.org/article/easing-lockdown-digital-applications-can-help) published on 1 May 2020 and written by Alice Mesnard and Paul Seabright. The idea was recognised by T.E. Shaw from the [Linux Foundation Publish Health](https://www.lfph.io) and a pilot implementation done w/ the help of Charlie Cox from Digytle and a crew from Aux Nederland B.V.

### Wikipedia Operational Model (Open Source and Free For ALl)

AccessApp differs from the commercial booking apps in three ways.

* It is open source.
* It is free for all (funded through crowd donations and public funding)
* It focuses on the needs of Places and visitors prioritising public health and the needs of marginal groups, focusing on the value creation, regardless of the commercial value.

## Introduction

AccessApp enables easier organisation of better visitor experience, especially during time of pandemic:

* Places
  * to provide Visitors with safe and easy to plan experience
  * to provide Vulnerable Visitors with slots gentle on their vulnerability (for example slots with reduced number of visitors for weaker visitors during time of pandemic and slots with significantly reduced number of visitors for visitors with very weak immune system)
  * easy to plan experience includes planned queueing and guaranteed visit
* Visitors
  * planned visits
  * safer visits
  * even safe visits for vulnerable

AccessApp follows an open source, open governance and collaboratively funded non-proft operational model, which gives Places additional advantages such as:

* No vendor lock
* The interest of the community, the visitors and of the place are in focus
* The collaboratively funded non-profit operational model allows even places, who cannot affort a solution or have a complex budgeting process, to have a solution in a timely manner

## How does it work?

The AccessApp consists of three Apps——

- AccessApp Visitor
- AccessApp Place(s), and
- AccessApp Administrator.

There is additionally AccessApp Server.

### AccessApp Visitor

AccessApp Visitor allows Visitor(s) to discover Places and book slots.

### AccessApp Place(s)

AccessApp Place(s) allows the owner(s) or operator(s) of Place(s) to add and configure each Place.

### AccessApp Administrator

AccessApp Administrator allows the AccessApp Operator to allow Place(s).

## Operational Model

The AccessApp is Open Source and is supported by a broad community of maintainers. Aux Nederlands B. V. provides a reference implementation following a not-for-profit open-books model, which reference implementation can be commercially booked and used. Additionally anyone is welcome to download, implement and operate the App. The community of maintainers can be contracted in such cases, as can be Aux Nederland B. V. The AccessApp is actively looking for implementing and operating partners in every country and from every languages in the world. Additional maintainers are welcome at any time.

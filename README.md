# AccessApp

## Introduction

AccessApp enables operators of Places to provide Visitors with higher quality experience by limiting the number of visitors and enabling easy booking.

The App can help provide Visitors with higher quality epxerience during crowded high season. It can be used as well to enable and protect visits by vulnerable people during epidemics.

## How does it work?

The AccessApp consists of three Apps——AccessApp Visitor, AccessApp Place(s) and AccessApp Administrator.

There is additionally AccessApp Server.

### AccessApp Visitor

AccessApp Visitor allows Visitor(s) to discover Places and book slots.

### AccessApp Place(s)

AccessApp Place(s) allows the owner(s) or operator(s) of Place(s) to add and configure each Place.

### AccessApp Administrator

AccessApp Administrator allows the AccessApp Operator to allow Place(s).

## Operational Model

The AccessApp is Open Source and is supported by a broad community of maintainers. Aux Nederlands B. V. provides a reference implementation following a not-for-profit open-books model, which reference implementation can be commercially booked and used. Additionally anyone is welcome to download, implement and operate the App. The community of maintainers can be contracted in such cases, as can be Aux Nederland B. V. The AccessApp is actively looking for implementing and operating partners in every country and from every languages in the world. Additional maintainers are welcome at any time.
